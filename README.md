# World countries development clustering

Using data about development indicators in the world, we have created a clustering model that based on these parameters classify each country in five categories:

    - Highly underdeveloped country
    - Underdeveloped country
    - Emerging country
    - Developed country
    - Highly developed country

The database used counts with 10 features and 167 records.
